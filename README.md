# CG-OpenGL-Labs 
Simply a repo for self-explanatory OpenGL labs as taught by Eng. Yehia.

🚅 VSCode extensions you'll need are BetterComments and ᑌᑎotes Remark - Markdown WYSIWYG.

❇️ Whenever there's a markdown file read it first using Unotes (Lab 1 and Lab 5)

❇️ Starting from lab 1 whatever is new in the next lab is enclosed within //{_______ and //_________} 

❇️ In labs 6 and 7 many changes were undergone through the tutorial, thus you'll find many main files. Start by openning main.cpp 
there you'll be able to change the value of a variable run to choose different mains (each associated with an interval within the tutorial's time.) Before
reading the commends within each of the main files, read what's written under the #include in main.cpp

Side notes:

1 - Lab 1, 2, 3 are very related.

2 - Lab 4 is foundational for all further labs.

3 - In lab 4, the code to draw is slightly modified (to become more intuitive) and then encapsulated in a function. (will be used in all further labs.)

4 - Sometimes a small part in the beginning of a lab (e.g. lab 5) is rather introduced in the previous lab.

For being there when I needed help due to compatibility issues or other.
